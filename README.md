# Kinect-Fusion-for-Gaming
Project focusing on the integration of KinectFusion with game development. 

This is a group project for the course 3D Scanning and Motion Capture offered at the Technical University of Munich. 

# Project Goals
The key goals for this project are to:
1. Implement the KinectFusion algorithm outlined by Izadi in 2011.
2. Integrate 3D-reconstructed scenes into Unity.
3. Create a simple car rig that can drive around the reconstructed scene and award users for safe driving. 

# Project Pipeline
For this project, we are implementing the following game engine integration pipeline that combines the KinectFusion pipeline with the a pre-fabricated driving model in Unity3D.
