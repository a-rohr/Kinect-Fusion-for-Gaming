Here are the important details concerning the game.
This is only a test platform and so has limited features regarding resolution, key binding etc.

There are three dropdown menus at the start of the game:
1. First menu lets you pick the car.
2. Second menu lets you pick one of the predefined game scenes.
3. Third menu lets you pick a scene that is self recored and found in the folder "Streaming Assets". Only OBJ scenes are found and handled by the importer.

Following controls:
In driving mode:
W,A,S,D - control the car and turn.
Q - shifting up in the gearbox.
E - shifting down in the gearbox.
Ctrl - braking with the car.
Shift - enter or leave flying mode.

In flying mode:
W,A,S,D - control the car and turn.
Ctrl - increase the hover height.
Alt - decrease the hover height.
Space - enter precision mode (increments hover steps by 1).

Esc - opens up the menu.

NOTE: using the third menu makes use of the OBJ-Importer. This function can take a while to import the scenes (5 minutes wait times are normal).
